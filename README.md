My Cat Store

It is an online store. It has a shopping cart and the option to include delivery. There is also a discount code option.

Installation is easy, you can run it through GitHub or download the files then run it through your local machine

It is very simple to use. You select the item you want to buy and add it to your cart, you select delivery and add a discount code. You finalize the order and take your reference number downn. The cart can be cleared and you can start again. It is a simulated situation, you are not actually buying anything.
